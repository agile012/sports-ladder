### Challenge Rules
You can challenge players ranked above you to steal their spot!
- **Range**: You can typically challenge players up to 3 spots above you (configurable per sport).
- **Novice Bonus**: If you have played fewer than 2 matches, you can challenge anyone up to 10 spots above.
- **Cooldown**: You cannot challenge the same player twice within a short period (e.g., 7 days).

## Making a Challenge
1. Find a player with a **Swords Icon** next to their name on the Ladder or Home page.
2. Click the icon to send a challenge.
3. The opponent receives an email notification (if enabled) and a dashboard alert.
4. Once accepted, the match is "Scheduled".

## Playing & Scoring
After playing your match, the winner (or either player) must submit the results.

### Submission
1. Go to the match in your **Dashboard**.
2. Click **Submit Result**.
3. Select the Winner and enter the scores (if supported by the sport).
   - Some sports track simple wins, others track sets (e.g., 21-19, 21-15).

### Verification
- The other player must **Confirm** the result.
- Disputes can be raised if the score is incorrect.
- Once confirmed, ratings are updated immediately.
